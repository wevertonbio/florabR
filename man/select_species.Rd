vegetation type. It can be "in", "only", "not_in" and "and". See details for
more about this argument.}

\description{
select_species allows filter species based on its
characteristics and distribution available in Brazilian Flora 2020
}
\details{
It's possible to choose 4 ways to filter by lifeform, by habitat,
by biome, by state and by vegetation type:
"in": selects species that have any occurrence of the determined values. It
allows multiple matches. For example, if Biome = c("Amazon", Cerrado" and
filter_Biome = "in", it will select all species that occur in the Amazon and
Cerrado, some of which may also occur in other biomes.

"only": selects species that have only occurrence of the determined values.
It allows only single matches. For example, if Biome = c("Amazon", "Cerrado")
and filter_Biome = "only", it will select all species that occur exclusively
in both the Amazon and Cerrado biomes, without any occurrences in other
biomes.

"not_in": selects species that don't have occurrence of the determined
values. It allows single and multiple matches. For example,
if Biome = c("Amazon", "Cerrado") and filter_Biome = "not_in", it will select
all species without occurrences in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes.

"and": selects species that have occurrence in all determined values. It
allows single and multiple matches. For example,
if Biome = c("Amazon", "Cerrado") and filter_Biome = "and", it will select
all species that occurs only in both the Amazon and Cerrado biomes,
including species that occurs in other biomes too.
