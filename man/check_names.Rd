\usage{
check_names(data, species, max_distance = 0.1,
                   include_subspecies= FALSE, include_variety = FALSE,
                   kingdom = "Plantae", parallel = FALSE, ncores = 1,

match_names(
  species,
  species_to_match,
  max_distance = 0.1,
  parallel = FALSE,
  ncores = 1,
  progress_bar = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{(data.frame) the data.frame imported with the
\code{\link{load_florabr}} function.}

\item{species}{(character) names of the species to be checked.}

\item{max_distance}{(numeric) Maximum distance (as a fraction) allowed for
searching suggestions when the name is misspelled. It can be any value
between 0 and 1. The higher the value, the more suggestions are returned.
For more details, see \code{\link[base:agrep]{agrep}}. Default = 0.1.}

\item{include_subspecies}{(logical) whether to include subspecies. Default = FALSE}

\item{include_variety}{(logical) whether to include varieties. Default = FALSE}

\item{kingdom}{(character) the kingdom to which the species belong. It can
be "Plantae" or "Fungi". Default = "Plantae".}

\item{parallel}{(logical) whether to run in parallel. Setting this to \code{TRUE}
is recommended for improved performance when working with 100 or more species.}

\item{ncores}{(numeric) number of cores to use for parallel processing.
Default is 1. This is only applicable if \code{parallel = TRUE}.}

\item{progress_bar}{(logical) whether to display a progress bar during processing.
Default is FALSE}

\item{species_to_match}{(character) a vector of species names to match against
the \code{species} parameter.}
}
\value{
a data.frame with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item input_name: the species names informed in species argument
\item Spelling: indicates if the species name is Correct (a perfect match with a
species name in the Flora e Funga do Brasil), Probably_incorrect
(partial match), or Not_found (no match with any species).
\item Suggested name: If Spelling is Correct, it is the same as the input_name.
If Spelling is Probably_correct, one or more suggested names are listed,
found according to the maximum distance. If Spelling is "Not_found", the value
is NA.
\item Distance: The integer Levenshtein edit distance. It represents the number
of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required
to transform the input_name into the Suggested_name.
\item taxonomicStatus: the taxonomic status of the species name ("Accepted" or
"Synonym").
\item nomenclaturalStatus: the nomenclatural status of the species name. This
information is not available for all species.
\item acceptedName: If the species name is not accepted or incorrect, the
accepted name of the specie. If the species name is accepted and correct,
the same as input_name and Suggested_name.
\item family: the family of the specie.
}
}
\description{
\code{check_names} checks if the species names are correct and searches
for suggestions if the name is misspelled or not found in the Flora e Funga
do Brasil database

\code{match_names} finds approximate matches to the specified pattern (species)
within each element of the string \code{x} (species_to_match). It is used internally
by \code{check_names}.
