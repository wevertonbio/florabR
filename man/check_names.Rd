\title{Check species names}
\usage{
check_names(data, species, max_distance = 0.1, Kingdom = "Plantae")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{(data.frame) the data.frame imported with the
\code{\link{load_florabr}} function.}

\item{species}{(character) names of the species to be checked.}

\item{max_distance}{(numeric) Maximum distance (as a fraction) allowed for
searching suggestions when the name is misspelled. It can be any value
between 0 and 1. The higher the value, the more suggestions are returned.
For more details, see \code{\link[base:agrep]{agrep}}. Default = 0.1.}

\item{Kingdom}{(character) the kingdom to which the species belong. It can
be "Plantae" or "Fungi". Default = "Plantae".}
}
\value{
a data.frame with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item input_name: the species names informed in species argument
\item Spelling: indicates if the species name is Correct (a perfect match with a
species name in the Brazilian Flora 2020), Probably_incorrect
(partial match), or Not_found (no match with any species).
\item Suggested name: If Spelling is Correct, it is the same as the input_name.
If Spelling is Probably_correct, one or more suggested names are listed,
found according to the maximum distance. If Spelling is "Not_found", the value
is NA.
\item Distance: The integer Levenshtein edit distance. It represents the number
of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required
to transform the input_name into the Suggested_name.
\item taxonomicStatus: the taxonomic status of the species name ("Accepted" or
"Synonym").
\item nomenclaturalStatus: the nomenclatural status of the species name. This
information is not available for all species.
\item acceptedName: If the species name is not accepted or incorrect, the
accepted name of the specie. If the species name is accepted and correct,
the same as input_name and Suggested_name.
\item family: the family of the specie.

check_names checks if the species names are correct and searches
for suggestions if the name is misspelled or not found in the Brazilian
Flora 2020 database.
