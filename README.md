[Brazilian Flora
2020](https://floradobrasil.jbrj.gov.br/consulta/)
is the most comprehensive work to reliably document Brazilian plant
diversity. It involves the work of hundreds of taxonomists, integrating
data from plant and fungi collected in Brazil during the last two
centuries. The database contains detailed and standardized morphological
descriptions, illustrations, nomenclatural data, geographic
distribution, and keys for the identification of all native and
non-native plants found in Brazil.

The florabR package includes a collection of functions designed to
retrieve, filter and spatialize data from the Brazilian Flora 2020
dataset.

## Overview of functions

### Download and import Brazilian Flora Dataset

-   `check_version()`: Check if you have the latest version of Brazilian
    Flora dataset available.
-   `get_florabr()`: Download the latest version of Brazilian Flora 2020
    database.
-   `load_florabr()`: Load Brazilian Flora database.

### Check names

-   `check_names()`: Check species names.
-   `get_binomial()`: Extract the binomial name (Genus + specific
    epithet) from a complete Scientific Name.

### Select or subset species

-   `get_attributes()`: Get available attributes to filter species.
-   `select_by_vernacular()`: Search for taxa using vernacular names.
-   `select_species()`: Select species based on its characteristics and
    distribution.
-   `subset_species()`: Extract a subset of species from Brazilian Flora
    2020 database.

### Spatialize distribution and use Brazilian Flora to flag records

-   `filter_florabr()`: Identify records outside natural ranges
    according to Brazilian Flora 2020.
-   `get_spat_occ()`: Get Spatial polygons (SpatVectors) of species
    based on its distribution (States and Biomes) according to Brazilian
    Flora
    2020. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of florabr from
[GitHub](https://github.com/wevertonbio/florabr) with:

``` r
if(!require(devtools)){
    install.packages("devtools")
}

if(!require(florabr)){
devtools::install_github('wevertonbio/florabr')}

library(florabr)
```

Before downloading the data available in the Brazilian Flora 2020, we
need to create a folder to save the data:

``` r
#Creating a folder in a temporary directory
#Replace 'file.path(tempdir(), "florabr")' by a path folder to be create in your computer
my_dir <- file.path(file.path(tempdir(), "florabr"))
dir.create(my_dir)
```

You can now utilize the `get_florabr` function to retrieve the most
recent version of the data:

``` r
get_florabr(output_dir = my_dir, #directory to save the data
            data_version = "latest", #get the most recent version available
            overwrite = T) #Overwrite data, if it exists
```

You also have the option to download an older, specific version of the
Brazilian Flora dataset. To explore the available versions, please refer
to [this
link](https://ipt.jbrj.gov.br/jbrj/resource?r=lista_especies_flora_brasil).
For downloading a particular version, simply replace 'latest' with the
desired version number. For example:

``` r
get_florabr(output_dir = my_dir, #directory to save the data
            data_version = "393.385", #Version 393.385, published on 2023-07-21
            overwrite = T) #Overwrite data, if it exists
```

## Loading data

In order to use the other functions of the package, you need to load the
data into your environment. To achieve this, utilize the
`load_florabr()` function. By default, the function will automatically
search for the latest available version in your directory. However, you
have the option to specify a particular version using the *data_version*
parameter. Additionally, you can choose between two versions of the
data: the 'short' version (containing the 19 columns required for run
the other functions of the package) or the 'complete' version (with all
original 39 columns). The function imports the 'short' version by
default.

``` r
#Load the short version
bf <- load_florabr(data_dir = my_dir,
                   data_version = "Latest_available",
                   type = "short") #short
```
